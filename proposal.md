My proposal is for a Galactica/Galaxia/Space Invaders inspired arcade game. 

The player controls a ship on the bottom of the display. The top of the display has several "enemy" sprites that move and shoot projectiles down towards the player. 
The player needs to dodge the projectiles being shot down while also using its own projectiles to eliminate all of the enemies.

The player will have 3 lives, each time an enemy projectile makes contact with the user 1 life is lost. Once all 3 lives are lost a game over screen will appear.

The user will receive points for each enemy they destroy and will win if all of the enemies on the screen are destroyed.
